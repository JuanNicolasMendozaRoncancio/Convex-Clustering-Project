# Code Folder

This is the folder where all the project code can be found.

The code is organized as follows:

* `boosting.py` contains the 4 boosting algorithms presented in the paper "A New Perspective on Linear Regression". This was the first module programmed.
* In `ProveLasso VS R-FS VS Path-R-RFS`, one of the results from the paper "A New Perspective on Linear Perspective on Linear Regression" is verified: The $R-FS$ and $Path R-FS$ algorithms approximate the solution to a Lasso problem.
* `ADMMAMA.py` implements the $2$ algorithms presented in the paper "Splitting Methods for Convex Clustering" to solve the Convex Clustering problem.
* In this test `ProveADMM&AMA`, the `ADMMAMA.py` tests are run on a toy dataset.
* In `tests`, general code tests are performed.

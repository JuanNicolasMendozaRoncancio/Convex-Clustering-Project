# Convex-Clustering-Project

Thanks to my academic performance at UNAL (National University of Colombia), I had the opportunity to participate in an academic exchange program with Universidad de los Andes. This project was born from that experience and aims to better understand the data clustering problem from the perspective of convex optimization.

This repository is organized as follows:
